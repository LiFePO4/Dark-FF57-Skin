# Dark-FF57-Skin
This little project of mine was to create a dark theme for the new Firefox 57/Quantum. I had previosly been using one of the top rated skins for FF but it became incompatible. There were many stylish themes and my use and learning of the browser toolbox to get to this point; I want to thank everyone that I "borrowed" the free code out there to make this possible!
